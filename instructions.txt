Create an android flutter app called Pocket Cowbell. Below are the instructions.
1.  The app starts with a splash screen that displays a text "Welcome to Pocket Cowbell!" and "Hold TIGHT and ring with all your MIGHT!"
2.  The user has to tap a button "BEGIN" to start the app.
3.  As soon as the user taps "BEGIN", the app loads a background image of a cowbell.
4.  The user is able to move the cowbell in any direction by moving the phone in any direction.
5.  The cowbell has a clang sound when the user moves it to and fro.
6.  There is a menu option on the left corner of the cowbell which displays options "COWBELLS", "SOUNDS", and "MODES" when tapped on.
7.  When the user taps on "COWBELLS", a list of options are displayed - Maroon, Gold, Pink, and Toon.
8.  When the user taps on any of these options, the cowbell changes to that color.
9.  When the user taps on "SOUNDS", a list of options are displayed - Clang, Clong, Cling, Clung, and GOAT.
10. When the user taps on any of these options, the cowbell sound changes to that sound.
